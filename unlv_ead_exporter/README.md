# UNLV EAD Exporter

The UNLV EAD exporter customizes data generated from EAD and PDF exports of resource records. The EAD exporter was designed to work in conjunction with the institutionâ€™s XSLT stylesheet. The EAD exporter makes the following adjustments: changes dash to period in the unitid (identifier); removes the titleproper tag (instead the finding aid title is rendered on PDF cover page); adds publisher to the copyright statement; adds relator translation (complete spelling instead of abbreviation); adds parentheses around container summary (part of extent).

## Installing it

To install, just activate the plugin in your config/config.rb file by
including an entry such as:

     # If you have other plugins loaded, just add 'unlv_ead_exporter' to
     # the list
     AppConfig[:plugins] = ['local', 'other_plugins', 'unlv_ead_exporter']
	 
	 Copy the stylesheets to your own stylesheets folder under:
	 
	 location_of_archivesspace/stylesheets

	 To change the logo add your own png file and in the as-ead-pdf.xsl file
	 change "logo-special-collections.png" to your own logo name
