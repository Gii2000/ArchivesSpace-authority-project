# ArchivesSpace-authority-project
  -------------------------------
The ArchivesSpace Authority Project is in place by the UNLV Libraries Special Collections to add and fix functionality to the imports and exports for ArchivesSpace
and add other functionality needed by the UNLV Libraries Special Collection through the use of ArchivesSpace Plugins.

# Projects


# Plugin Settings

Plugin Settings is a test to implement settings for a plugin following the structure of the preferences in ArchivesSpace.

[Plugin Settings](https://github.com/l3mus/ArchivesSpace-authority-project/tree/master/plugin_settings).


# Spawn

The Spawn plugin creates easy to use links to spawn multiple records at the same time.
Note: data that is created from spawn has been modified to fit UNLV's Oral Histories. Also, the plugin does not batch spawn multiple accessions at once, it just facilitates the procedure for batch spawning records.
